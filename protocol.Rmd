### Introduction

One potential role of the school system is to decrease inequalities in
the resources for learning between socioeconomically advantaged and
disadvantaged children. A young school starting age may help more
disadvantaged children by compensating for their more limited learning
resources at home. However there is danger with such an approach, as
there is evidence that being relatively young in a school year is a
disadvantage that could even offset any additional benefit of starting
school early. For more advantaged children when they start school or are
younger in the year may be less important as home resources can
compensate. For example, Suziedelytea and Zhu [@SUZIEDELYTE201576] found
that while early school starting age had positive impacts for cognitive
ability in young primary school children in Australia, particularly
those disadvantaged, it had negative impacts on social development
across the socioeconomic spectrum. In Scotland, children whose 4th
birthday is in February will normally start school that August while
those born March onward will start the following August. Pupils not aged
five by the August start can delay school a year with those born in
January and February who delay automatically entitled to an extra year
of nursery provision however this is discretionary for those born
September to December. Latest figures for Scotland show that
socio-economic more advantaged parents are more likely to defer their
child's start [@sg2020].

While much work in Scotland has been conducted on pupils social and
emotional in Scotland in recent years and some focus has been paid to
school readiness and starting age, most reports associations rather than
a causal focus . This is a significant gap as there is consistent
evidence from natural experiment studies in other countries that school
starting age can affect the likelihood of mental health problems and of
a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
[@Dee2018; @chen2015; @ELDER2010641; @EVANS2010657; @SCHWANDT201672].
Here it is school starting age affecting relative age within the school
year that is the studied mechanism. Most studies assess these affects by
socioeconomic background finding that impacts across the socioeconomic
spectrum but sometimes less so in those more advantaged [@Dee2018;
@chen2015; @ELDER2010641; @EVANS2010657]. A German study suggests that
more educated parents may be more likely to seek an ADHD diagnosis got
their young for year child but recognizes their evidence for this is
weak [@SCHWANDT201672]. Crawford et al. [-@crawford2014] outline the
four possible mechanisms through which age at starting school might
impact education and wellbeing outcomes: age at test, age of starting
school, length of schooling and relative age. As exams are generally
taken at the same time, age at test may be an important mechanism. By
studying test taken at the same age, they showed that most of the effect
of starting age on test performance in England was through age at test.
Analysis of England's PISA test scores (where the sample is age selected
so age at test is less of a factor) found little impact of school
starting cut-off, this was interpreted as an extra year of schooling
(length of schooling) having little effect [@Luyten2008; @benton2014].
It could also be driven by age of starting school or relative age
effects or a combination of all three offsetting. Luyten et al.
[-@Luyten2008] suggest that any positive effect of being in a higher
grade was greatest in more disadvantaged pupils. This raises the
possibility of a trade off between better test scores and worse mental
wellbeing especially for disadvantaged pupils

The Scottish Green Party has recently advocated a school starting age of
7 for academic and wellbeing reasons
<https://greens.scot/news/scottish-greens-kids-should-start-school-at-seven>
. The policy was informed by a commission review of international
studies [@bradfield2021] but does not include direct evidence from
Scotland.

We are using The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)
2018 data for Scotland (and England as a comparison). PISA surveys 15
years old students (with some leeway so includes some aged 16 ) in
formal schooling in countries across the OECD using a standard framework
with local adaptations. The core aim is to assess and compare countries
on students' literacy in reading, maths and science. School based
fieldwork in Scotland between 8th October and 14th December 2018. A two
stage stratified sample was employed, schools and then students in
schools were sampled (for details see [@sg2018]). Scotland had an 81%
participation rate meeting the 80% target of the OECD. Surveys were
computer administered and in addition to assessing the core literacies
students completed a questionnaire covering their socio-economic
background and their wellbeing which we draw on in this study as well.
The Scottish questionnaires are available to download at
[[http://www.oecd.org/pisa/publications/UK%20(Scotland).zip](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/publications/UK%20(Scotland).zip)](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/publications/UK%20(Scotland).zip)
. As PISA is aimed at a specific age, it can cover a number of school
years (grades in PISA terminology) . In Scotland the sample was split
between S4 and S5 pupils (PISA grades 11 and 12) , the few in other
years are excluded in our analysis as are any pupils who said they had
repeated a school year. These exclusions reduced the sample from 2998
pupils to 2802 pupils. Given the complex survey design all analysis
incorporates replication weights and student weights. The weights are
scaled to the population rather than the sample hence why in the
following table the sample size is 42,243. Table 1 describes the sample
overall and by school year. We include four measures of socio-economic
position. PISA's summary scale is the index of economic, social and
cultural status (ESCS). It is based on three indices, parental education
(International Standard Classification of Education[)]{.ul}, parental
occupation (International Socio-Economic Index) and PISA's home
possessions scale. There is some imputation for missing data when
calculating the ESCS.

#### Design

As illustrated in Figure 1 Scotland's February / March cut off leads to
a large jump in the probability of being in S4 as opposed to S5. This
allows a regression discontinuity design. Figure 2 shows the
distribution of month of birth and we ran a test to see if there was
evidence of bunching in the distribution of month of birth at the school
starting cut-off, there does not seem to be
(p=`r round(density_result$results[[3]], 2)`).

```{r fig1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1 - The probability of being in S4 by date of birth."}
include_graphics("fig1.png")

```

```{r fig2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 2 - The distribution of month of birth"}
include_graphics("fig2.png")

```

We will compare those in S4 to S5 in the month either side of the
cut-off ,in other words those born in February and March. Table 2 shows
that those deferring are more likely to be male and (slightly) more
advantaged. Because deferral is not random we will use month of birth as
an instrument for school year, a fuzzy regression discontinuity.
Instrumental analysis has the following three assumptions.

```{r table 2, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}

knit_print(table2a)

```

1.  Being either side of the cut point is a cause of the school year you
    are in.

This is the national rule on entry and its effect is illustrated in
Figure 1.

2.  Being either side of the cut point only affects our outcomes via
    school year.

One potential violation of this is through age as by definition those
born in February are a month older. One argument is that as school exams
are not taken at the same age that February born, being a year ahead,
will take their exams at a younger age. Hence age is a mechanism through
which school year impacts outcomes and so this differential is not a
violation of this assumption. As a comparison we will run the same
analysis for England where (see Figure 3) the cut date is in August and
all pupils in PISA are in the same year.

3.  Being either side of the cut and the outcomes do not share common
    cause.

Although there is evidence that season of birth might be affected by
socio-economic position [@Buckles2013], systematic month to next month
variation seems less likely. As Table 4 shows those born in February are
very similar in socio-economic profile to those born in March with some
minor differences in education background.

#### Analysis

We will use a version of instrumental variable analysis that accounts
for the survey design. As there are large number of outcomes we shall be
cautious to not over emphasise single "significant" results but to take
a holistic approach to assessing whether there is a consistent pattern
of results. Additionally our analysis may be underpowered so we will be
cautious in claiming no effect when results are imprecise. Although
missing data is relatively low we will attempt to adjust for this in
sensitivity analysis using inverse probability weighting.

To test for effect modification by socio-economic background we shall
interact grade with our socio-economic variables. We will see whether
comparing the extremes of advantage and disadvantage are important by
using quartiles of the continuous socio-economic measures.

##### Sensitivity analysis

-   Extend analysis to include January born pupils in the control group.


#### Outcomes

##### Wellbeing

We will use the PISA framework of wellbeing that covers three main
dimensions (cognitive, psychological and social) [@govorova2020]. We
focus on 14 scales in these domains. These scales, apart from two single
question scales, were constructed from a number of questions (see
appendix each question) by the PISA study using item response theory
(IRT) scaling. The scales have a mean 0 and a standard deviation of 1
across the OECD. Negative scores mean that the score was below the OECD
average but could be based on positive responses to the scales
questions. The PISA technical report contains full details of the IRT
scaling .<http://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/pisa2018technicalreport/>

Table 4 sets out the domains and their scales while the specific
questions are in Tables A1 to A14 in the appendix.

```{r table 4, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}

knit_print(table4b)
```

##### Ability

PISA measures academic ability in three core subject areas, maths,
reading and science. As students answer different subsets of the
questions for each subject, multiple imputation is used to combine the
10 plausible values for each student on each scale in PISA.
