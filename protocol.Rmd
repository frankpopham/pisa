### Introduction

There is international variation in when children start primary
schooling with continuing debate about the optimal age [@oecd2016]. Some
stress the importance of a later start for children to allow them to
learn through play for a longer period and to increase their readiness
to school. Others instead highlight that children are capable to learn
from early ages and that learning basic reading, writing and numeracy
skills enable children to get a head start in learning. In addition,
there are reasons to believe that the start age of school may matter for
social inequalities in educational and well-being outcomes. Since there
is often some discretion about the time children can start school, there
may be differences in the extent to which parents with different
socio-economic resources exercise this discretion, with more socially
advantaged parents delaying entry of their children if they deem them
too young or not ready for school. Latest figures for Scotland confirm
that this is the case here [@sg2020]. If starting school early is
detrimental then this disadvantage may be falling disproportionately on
the more disadvantaged. On the other hand, an early school starting age
may help more disadvantaged children by compensating for their more
limited learning resources at home. However, there are potential
negative consequences of this choice, as there is evidence that being
relatively young in a school year is a disadvantage that could even
offset any additional benefit of starting school early. For more
advantaged children, at which age they start school and whether they are
younger in the year may be less important as home resources can
compensate. Suziedelytea and Zhu [-@SUZIEDELYTE201576] found that while
early school starting age had positive impacts for cognitive ability in
young primary school children in Australia, particularly those
disadvantaged, it had negative impacts on social development across the
socio-economic spectrum.

#### Background

Children in Scotland are among the youngest in Europe to start school.
They usually start when they are between four and a half and five and a
half years old. There is a longstanding debate whether this early start
may be detrimental for children. Most recently an increase in school
starting age to 7 has been advocated following countries such as
Finland, a country that performs comparatively well in terms of student
outcomes
(<https://greens.scot/news/scottish-greens-kids-should-start-school-at-seven>).
In Scotland, children whose 5th birthday is between March and August
will normally start school in August of the same year while those born
between 1 September and the end of February will start in August in the
year before they turn 5. These latter children can delay entry to school
by a year, with those born in January and February automatically
entitled to an extra year of funded nursery provision (this funded
provision is dependent on their local council's approval for those born
in September-December). A major part of the Scottish Government's
*"Getting it right for every child"* strategy is improving wellbeing ,
this wellbeing framework is in turn linked to efforts to improve
academic performance and reduce the socio-economic performance gap
(<https://www.gov.scot/policies/girfec/>). While much work in Scotland
has been conducted on pupils' social and emotional wellbeing in recent
years and some focus has been paid to school readiness and starting age,
most reports are associational rather than having a causal focus
[@sgreview2018; @sg2012]. This is a significant gap as there is
consistent evidence from natural experiment studies in other countries
that school starting age can affect wellbeing and educational
performnace.

Crawford et al. [-@crawford2014] outline the four possible mechanisms
through which age at starting school might impact education and
wellbeing outcomes: age at test, age of starting school, length of
schooling and relative age. As exams are generally taken at the same
time, age at test may be an important mechanism. By studying tests taken
at the same age, they showed that most of the effect of starting age on
test performance in England was through age at test. Analysis of
England's PISA test scores (where the sample is age selected so age at
test is less of a factor) found little impact of school starting
cut-off, this was interpreted as an extra year of schooling (length of
schooling) having little effect [@Luyten2008; @benton2014]. It could
also be driven by age of starting school or relative age effects or a
combination of all three offsetting. Luyten et al. [-@Luyten2008]
suggest that any positive effect of being in a higher grade was greatest
in more disadvantaged pupils. This raises the possibility of a trade off
between better test scores and worse mental wellbeing especially for
disadvantaged pupils. However, a regression discontinuity study from
England found that an earlier school start improved performance and
reduced the socio-economic gap for both academic performance and
"non-cognitive" outcomes although by age 11 the academic effects had
worn off [@Cornelissen2019]. Literature exploring how school starting
age affects relative age within the school year consistently finds
mental health problems and a diagnosis of attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to be higher in young for year pupils
[@Dee2018; @chen2015; @ELDER2010641; @EVANS2010657; @SCHWANDT201672].
Most studies assess these effects by socio-economic background finding
impacts across the socio-economic spectrum but sometimes less so in
those more advantaged [@Dee2018; @chen2015; @ELDER2010641;
@EVANS2010657]. A German study suggests that more educated parents may
be more likely to seek an ADHD diagnosis for their young for year child
but recognizes their evidence for this is weak [@SCHWANDT201672].

#### Research questions

1.  Does starting school at an older age improve academic performance
    and well-being at age 15?
2.  Does the starting school age matter for social inequalities in
    educational and well-being outcomes?

### Method

#### Design

One possible way to study the effect of school starting age would be to
compare those who defer entry to those who do not. However, as already
described there are a number of differences between those who defer and
those that do not which may be difficult to control for using
observational data. An alternative strategy commonly used is to compare
those born around the cut-off point of starting school that year or a
year later. As illustrated in Figure 1 Scotland's February / March cut
off leads to a large jump in the probability of staring school a year
later (and so being in the lower year (S4 ) when observed in our data
aged 15). While there is some evidence that season of birth is not
random, for example more advantaged parents are less likely to have
winter births [@Buckles2013] , exactly planning date of birth to fall
either side of the school start cut-off point is less likely and so
comparing those just either side of the cut-off is akin to randomizing
school starting date. This is a regression discontinuity design.
Ideally, we would compare those born right at the end of February to
those right at the start of March, however the lack of precise date of
birth (we have month of birth) and a lack of numbers (we are using a
sample survey) precludes this. Instead, we compare those born in
February to those born in March. Here we are assuming that in this small
window there are few differences between February and March born and
even if there were these they would be small and we would be unlikely to
see large discontinuities in outcomes in the absence of the large jump
seen in the probability of school starting date. Having England as a
comparator allows us to assess any month of birth differences in a
neighbouring country that does not have the February / March cut-off but
has a similar starting age and education system.

Figure 2 shows the distribution of month of birth and we ran a test to
see if there was evidence of bunching in the distribution of month of
birth at the school starting cut-off, there does not seem to be
(p=`r round(density_result$results[[3]], 2)`).

Of course the option of deferral adds a layer of complexity. Table 1
shows that those deferring are more likely to be male and (slightly)
more advantaged. Because deferral is not random we will use month of
birth as an instrument for school year, a fuzzy regression
discontinuity. Instrumental analysis has the following four assumptions
[@hernan2020]

1.  Being either side of the cut point is a cause of the school year you
    are in.

This is the national rule on entry and its effect is illustrated in
Figure 1.

2.  Being either side of the cut point only affects our outcomes via
    school year.

One potential violation of this is through age as by definition those
born in February are a month older. One argument is that as school exams
are not taken at the same age that February born, being a year ahead,
will take their exams at a younger age. Hence age is a mechanism through
which school year impacts outcomes and so this differential is not a
violation of this assumption. As a comparison we will run the same
analysis for England where the cut date is in August and all pupils in
PISA are in the same school year.

3.  Being either side of the cut and the outcomes do not share common
    cause.

Although there is evidence that season of birth might be affected by
socio-economic position [@Buckles2013], systematic month to next month
variation seems less likely. As Table 3a shows those born in February
are very similar in socio-economic profile to those born in March with
some minor differences in education background.

4.  There are no always defiers

Always defiers are those that always do the opposite of what they are
assigned by the instrument to do. In our situation the default for those
February born would be to go to school that August but given deferral
some "defy" this. However for March born no deferral is possible so
defying is very unlikely. Hence the possibility of there being always
defiers is very small. The cost of this assumption over the alternative
fourth assumption of homogeneity is that our average effect is not for
the whole population but for people who would always follow the school
starting point associated with the pupil's month of birth. An advantage
of this is that it allows us to explore effect modification.

#### Data

We are using The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)
2018 data for Scotland (and England as a comparison). PISA surveys 15
years old students (with some leeway so includes some aged 16 ) in
formal schooling in countries across the OECD using a standard framework
with local adaptations. The core aim is to assess and compare countries
on students' literacy in reading, maths and science. School based
fieldwork in Scotland was between 8th October and 14th December 2018. A
two stage stratified sample was employed, schools and then students in
schools were (randomly) sampled (for details see [@sg2018]). Scotland
had an 81% participation rate meeting the 80% target of the OECD.
Surveys were computer administered and in addition to assessing the core
literacies students completed a questionnaire covering their
socio-economic background and their wellbeing which we draw on in this
study as well. The Scottish questionnaires are available to download at
[[http://www.oecd.org/pisa/publications/UK%20(Scotland).zip]](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/publications/UK%20(Scotland).zip)[(http://www.oecd.org/pisa/publications/UK%20(Scotland).zip)](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/publications/UK%20(Scotland).zip)
. As PISA is aimed at a specific age, it can cover a number of school
years (grades in PISA terminology) . In Scotland the sample was split
between S4 and S5 pupils (PISA grades 11 and 12) , the few in other
years are excluded in our analysis as are any pupils who said they had
repeated a school year. These exclusions reduced the sample from 2998
pupils to 2802 pupils with 257 born February 2003 and 245 born March 2003.
Given the complex survey design all analysis incorporates replication weights and
student weights provided with the PISA data. The weights are scaled to the
population rather than the sample hence why in
the following table the sample size is 42,243. Tables 2 a and b describe
the Scottish and English samples overall and by school year. We include
four measures of socio-economic position. PISA's summary scale is the
index of economic, social and cultural status (ESCS). It is based on
three indices, parental education (International Standard Classification
of Education[)]{.ul}, parental occupation (International Socio-Economic
Index) and PISA's home possessions scale. There is some imputation by
PISA for missing data when calculating the ESCS.

As a control we use England, its school cut off is August / September
with a starting age of 5. PISA fieldwork in 2018 happened at a similar
time to Scotland meaning that the whole school year was observed with no
change in grade at the February / March meaning that we can compare
differences in Scotland to those in England for those born at the
February / March cut-off.

#### Analysis

We predominately used R and Rstudio for data management, analysis and
writing of this protocol and will do so for planned work [@R-base;
@rstudio2021]. A R markdown file to replicate this protocol is available
at
[\<https://github.com/frankpopham/pisa\>](https://github.com/frankpopham/pisa).
To incorporate the survey design we use the *survey* and *srvyr*
packages [@R-survey; @R-srvyr]. We will use a version of the
instrumental variable analysis, through the *AER* and *survey* packages,
that incorporates the survey design [@R-survey; @r-aer]. All of our
outcomes are on a continuous scale or, in one case, ordinal and will be
analysed as continuous. Many of the variables come standardised in the PISA data (to
the PISA mean for all countries) to have a mean of 0 and a standard
deviation of 1 so we will present all results standardised and assess
the magnitude of effects relative to reported or sample standard
deviations.

As there are large number of outcomes we shall be cautious to not over
emphasise single "significant" results but to take a holistic approach
to assessing whether there is a consistent pattern of results with an
emphasis on effect sizes. Additionally our analysis may be underpowered
due to the number of cases so we will be cautious in claiming no effect
when results are imprecise. Although missing data is relatively low we
will attempt to adjust for this in sensitivity analysis using inverse
probability weighting.

To explore effect modification by socio-economic background we shall
interact school grade with our three socio-economic variables. We will
see whether comparing the extremes of advantage and disadvantage are
important by using quartiles of the continuous socio-economic measures.
We will focus on absolute inequalities as they are invariant to whether
we analyse outcomes as positive or negative whereas relative
inequalities are not .

##### Sensitivity analysis

-   Extend analysis to include January born pupils in the control group.

#### Outcomes

##### Wellbeing

We will use the PISA framework of wellbeing that covers three 
dimensions (cognitive, psychological and social) [@govorova2020]. We
focus on 14 scales in these domains. These scales, apart from two single
question scales, were constructed from a number of questions (see
appendix each question) by the PISA study using item response theory
(IRT) scaling. The scales have a mean 0 and a standard deviation of 1
across the OECD. Negative scores mean that the score was below the OECD
average but could be based on positive responses to the scales'
questions. The PISA technical report contains full details of the IRT
scaling .<http://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/pisa2018technicalreport/>

Table 4a and b sets out the domains and their scales while the specific
questions are in Tables A1 to A14 in the appendix.

```{r table 4, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}

```

##### Educational performance

PISA measures Educational performance in three core subject areas,
maths, reading and science. As students answer different but overlapping
subsets of the questions for each subject, multiple imputation is used
to combine the 10 plausible values for each student on each scale in
PISA. We will use *micombine* to do this [@R-mitools].
