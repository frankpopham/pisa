### Introduction

One potential role of the school system is to decrease inequalities in
the resources for learning between socioeconomically advantaged and
disadvantaged children. A young school starting age may help more
disadvantaged children by compensating for their more limited learning
resources at home. However there is danger with such an approach, as
there is evidence that being relatively young in a school year is a
disadvantage that could even offset any additional benefit of starting
school early. For more advantaged children when they start school or are
younger in the year may be less important as home resources can
compensate. For example, Suziedelytea and Zhu [@SUZIEDELYTE201576] found
that while early school starting age had positive impacts for cognitive
ability in young primary school children in Australia, particularly
those disadvantaged, it had negative impacts on social development
across the socioeconomic spectrum. In Scotland, children whose 4th
birthday is in February will normally start school that August while
those born March onward will start the following August. Pupils not aged
five by the August start can delay school a year with those born in
January and February who delay automatically entitled to an extra year
of nursery provision however this is discretionary for those born
September to December. While much work in Scotland has been conducted on
pupils social and emotional in Scotland in recent years (for an overview
see ) and some focus has been paid to school readiness and starting age,
most reports associations rather than a causal focus . This is a
significant gap as there is consistent evidence from natural experiment
studies in other countries that school starting age can affect the
likelihood of mental health problems and of a diagnosis of attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [@Dee2018; @chen2015;
@ELDER2010641; @EVANS2010657; @SCHWANDT201672]. Here it is school
starting age affecting relative age within the school year that is the
studied mechanism. Most studies assess these affects by socioeconomic
background finding that impacts across the socioeconomic spectrum but
sometimes less so in those more advantaged [@Dee2018; @chen2015;
@ELDER2010641; @EVANS2010657]. A German study suggests that more
educated parents may be more likely to seek an ADHD diagnosis got their
young for year child but recognizes their evidence for this is weak
[@SCHWANDT201672]. Crawford et al. [-@crawford2014] outline the four
possible mechanisms through which age at starting school might impact
education and wellbeing outcomes: age at test, age of starting school,
length of schooling and relative age. As exams are generally taken at
the same time, age at test may be an important mechanism. By studying
test taken at the same age, they showed that most of the effect of
starting age on test performance in England was through age at test.
Analysis of England's PISA test scores (where the sample is age selected
so age at test is less of a factor) found little impact of school
starting cut-off, this was interpreted as an extra year of schooling
(length of schooling) having little effect [@Luyten2008; @benton2014].
It could also be driven by age of starting school or relative age
effects or a combination of all three offsetting. Luyten et al.
[-@Luyten2008] suggest that any positive effect of being in a higher
grade was greatest in more disadvantaged pupils. This raises the
possibility of a trade off between better test scores and worse mental
wellbeing especially for disadvantaged pupils

### Method 

#### Data

We are using The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)
2018 data for Scotland (and England as a comparison). PISA surveys 15
years old students (with some leeway so includes some aged 16 ) in
formal schooling in countries across the OECD using a standard framework
with local adaptations. The core aim is to assess and compare countries
on students' literacy in reading, maths and science. School based
fieldwork in Scotland between 8th October and 14th December 2018. A two
stage stratified sample was employed, schools and then students in
schools were sampled (for details see [@sg2018]). Scotland had an 81%
participation rate meeting the 80% target of the OECD. Surveys were
computer administered and in addition to assessing the core literacies
students completed a questionnaire covering their socio-economic
background and their wellbeing which we draw on in this study as well.
The Scottish questionnaires are available to download at
[[http://www.oecd.org/pisa/publications/UK%20(Scotland).zip]](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/publications/UK%20(Scotland).zip)[(http://www.oecd.org/pisa/publications/UK%20(Scotland).zip)](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/publications/UK%20(Scotland).zip)
. As PISA is aimed at a specific age, it can cover a number of school
years (grades in PISA terminology) . In Scotland the sample was split
between S4 and S5 pupils (PISA grades 11 and 12) , the few in other
years are excluded in our analysis as any pupils who said they had
repeated a year. These exclusions reduced the sample from 2998 pupils to
2802 pupils. Given the complex survey design all analysis incorporates
replication weights and student weights. The weights are scaled to the
population rather than the sample hence why in the following the sample
size is 42,243. Table 1 describes the sample overall and by school year.
We include four measures of socio-economic position. PISA's summary
scale is the index of economic, social and cultural status (ESCS). It is
based on three indices, parental education (International Standard
Classification of Education[)]{.ul}, parental occupation (International
Socio-Economic Index) and PISA's home possessions scale. There is some
imputation for missing data when calculating the ESCS.



```{r table 1, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
knit_print(svytable1)

```

#### Design

As illustrated in Figure 1 Scotland's February / March cut off leads to
a large jump in the probability of being in S4 as opposed to S5. This
allows a regression discontinuity design.

```{r fig1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1 - The probability of being in grade 11 by date of birth."}
include_graphics("svyfig1.png")

```

There are two types of regression discontinuity , local randomisation
and continuity. We have the running variable of date of birth with a cut
point in Feb / March that means the probability of one less year (S4) of
schooling at nearly the same age jumps. Our effect is local to those at
the cut point, in other words those born in Feb / March. As we only have
a discrete date of birth (we do not know day only month and year) the
more natural approach is local randomisation. Here we limit analysis to
those in Feb and March, our window. Our assumptions are that the running
variable is not related to the potential outcomes in our window and that
treatment (grade) is effectively randomised.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

dob2 <- gbrpisadf2018 %>%
  filter(country=="Scotland") %>%
  mutate(dob2=as.period(interval(ymd("2003-03-01"),.$dob))) %>%
  mutate(dob2=as.numeric(dob2, "months")) %>%
  mutate(dob2=if_else(dob2>=0, dob2+1, dob2)) %>%
  select(dob2)

density_result <-  rdwinselect(dob2$dob2, wmin=1, nwindows=1)

```

-   To assess these assumptions (indirectly) table 2 compares those born
    February / March and the only main difference is a small one
    (obviously) in age. Also we can run a test to see if there is
    evidence of bunching in the distribution of month of birth at the
    cut point , there doesn't seem to be (p=r
    round(density_result\$results[[3]], 2)).


```{r table 2, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}

knit_print(svytable4)

```

-   Of course because of deferral option not everyone born February is
    in grade 12. Table 3 shows that those deferring are more likely to
    be male and (slightly) more advantaged. This obviously violates the
    assumptions set out?
-   Yes, but their is a solution. As the cut date is "random" it can be
    used as an instrument for grade. This is a so called "fuzzy"
    regression discontinuity.

\newpage



```{r table 3, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}

knit_print(svytable5)

```

-   The other flavour of regression discontinuity is based on the
    continuity assumption. Basically this allows the forcing variable
    (and de facto other variables) to be related to the outcome but in a
    smooth fashion so that any jump at the cut point can be assigned to
    the intervention. It involves fitting regression lines either side
    of the cut point in a window of data define by the forcing variable.
    With discrete data the lack of a continuous forcing variable is
    slightly problematic.

-   An attraction of also using this approach is that we can use age as
    the forcing variable, we might expect age to increase exam
    performance but not in a jump. This then allows us to account for
    any small age at test differences. Using England were everyone is in
    the same grade can also help with this.

-   As with local randomization there is also a fuzzy version of
    continuity regression discontinuity that works in the same way.

#### Outcomes

##### Wellbeing

We will use the PISA framework of wellbeing that covers three main
